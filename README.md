### About

Once the site [Gears](https://doremaxime.github.io/gear-frontend/) is fully developed without ember, this repo will be developed.
Furthermore, once both are finished there will be 2 versions of [Gears](https://doremaxime.github.io/gear-frontend/). I took this approach to fully understand the developemnt procedure of having a framework vs jquey/ajax.
I will update this README once the first version is fully developed and operational.
